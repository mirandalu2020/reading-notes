- To embed JS in JSX, the content should be enclosed in curly braces. And in React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, youâ€™ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code
- React respond to user's inputs using event listeners
- The word `use` indicates that a React components manages data with a hook, React components share data via states.
