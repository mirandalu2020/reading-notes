## Context API

### Choosing the State Structure[^1]

The five principles for structuring state: 

1. When more than one state is updated at once, put them into the same state
2. Do not have states that contradicts each other
3. Do not repeat states
4. Avoid duplicate states to avoid a state to be out-of-sync
5. Avoid deeply nested states, choose a flat state structure when possible

### Passing State Deeply with Context[^2]

- Contexts solve the issues when a parent is trying to pass props to its child's child, which involves passing through multiple layers in a tree.
- 
- `createContext` and `LevelContext` complementary to `useContext` for complex applications. `createContext` is required to create a context, and `LevelContext` allows the component to use the vlaue of the nearest `LevelContext.Provicer` in the UI tree above it.
- Props should still be considered before using contexts.
