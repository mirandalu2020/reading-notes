## `useState()` Hook

### Thinking in React[^1]

Five Steps of thinking in React: 

1. Break the UI into a component hierarchy by applying the single responsibility principle, where one component should do one thing only.
2. Build a static version in React by first building a bare-bone model without adding any interactivity
3. Find the minial nut complete representation of UI state. In this step, what should be held as a state and what needs to be passed around as props should be decided
4. Identify where the state should live. Since React has a hiereical flow, the state should be helod on the cloest parent components possible between siblings
5. Add inverse data flow

### State: A Componentâ€™s Memory[^2]

- A local variable isn't sufficient when multiple components are triggered by the same event, and local variables not only do not persist between renders, but also they don't trigger renders.
- `useState` hook allows the use of a state variable to regain the data between renders, and a state setter fnction allows updating variable and trigger React to render the component again
- Component A can access states in component B by adding the `useState` hook
