## Redux - Combined Reducers

### Multiple Reducers Example[^1]

- Because there may be multiple states to be updated and multiple events take place
- `combineReducers` can be used to combine multiple reducers, where the default values are set in the reducer `state` arguement
- A state can be managed as an immutable object by two ways: 

1. make a new state in the reducer

> newState = {...state}; return newState

2. make a new state in the action

> state = {...state, property: action.payload}
> //desctructure the state object, and only alter the property of interest in that action

### Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers[^2]

- `combineReducer()` is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing **Redux Reducers**.
- To assemble a new state tree, `combineReducers()` first call each slice reducer with its current slice of the state and the current action, and give the slice a chance to respond to the state if needed. So all reducers to get called when `combineReducers()` is used.
- To define initial state in an app, a store must be created using `createStore` which takes in the `preoadedState`. This initialize the setore with state that was previously presisted elsewhere in the app or browser's localstorage.

### Redux Docs: Combined Reducer Syntax[^3]

- As an app grows more complex, each reducing function should be separated into its own function to manage states independently. 
- The `combineReducer` helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to `createStore`.
- When naming reducers, a popular convention is to name reducers after the state slices they manage. So the developer can use the ES6 shorthand where `combineReducers({ counter, todos })` is equivalent to `combineReducers({ counter: counter, todos: todos })`
