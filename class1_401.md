# Class One Notes (401)

## Node.js[^1]

- Node.js is what we use to execute JavaScript without a browser, which in the other words, it's a JavaScript runtime.
- Node can be used for tool-building, automate JS app dev, run JS on the server in an event-driven manner.

## Things I want to know more about

- From the schedule, I am excited to learn about AWS tools. As I was browsing jobs, most of the employers now desire their candidates to have some knowledge of AWS services.
- My learning goal is to get used to importing and exporting modules, as well as using CI/CD (since that's also very much industry-relevant)
