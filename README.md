## *Growth Mindset*

Interpretation: Grwoth is developed with series of setbacks, failure is success in progress

- Reminder 1: steep leraning curve is expected, just think back to those days of quantum

- Reminder 2: coding is a process of fixing all the messed-ups, but at least I get a chance to fix it

- Reminder 3: try harder, there's a world of people and google out there to help

## *About Me*

My name is Miranda, and I come from both a physical science and mechanics background. After years of preparation towards an advanced degree, I evemtually realizedt that R&D in Chemistry was just not what I wanted to pursue for a living. Luckily by chance, I got a job offer from one of the tech companies in Seattle, since I have scripting experience with Python,  I decided to further leverage my math and analytics skills to enhance my career by learning coding in a more structural way.
