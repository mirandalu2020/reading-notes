# Class Three Notes

## Text Editors
**Vocab and new commands covered**

1. repository - files Git should pay attention to
2. cloning - bringing GitHub project to my computer (git clone xxxxxx(https or ssh link from github project))
3. git status (see modification history)
4. git add - add a file to current snapshot, stage the snapshotto the stage 
5. git add . -add all the files
6. git commit -m *insert message*  - add message (do not end message with !)
7. git push origin main - push local to branch "main"


**Things to note**
- ACP == add, commit, push
- if file staging is successful, git status will change the file name color from red to green; if commit successful, no green/red file should be seen
- local repository does NOT sync with github, must be pushed from origin,
