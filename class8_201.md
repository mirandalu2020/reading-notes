## CSS Layout

### CSS Flexbox[^1] [^2]

- "One dementional content" means many items with different sizes that can be laid out in a best-layout model
- the *Main Axis* is the `flex-direction` property, it can be either `row` or `colomn`. And the other irection is the *Cross Axis*
- Use of properties that reorder visual display away from how HTML orders things can impact accessibility, for instance `row-rever` or `column-reverse` can negatively impact accessibility as reverse the flow of things which is also the reverse of what a screen reader will follow

- Advantages of using a `flexbox` over `float` include: it allows elements to be verticcally centered inside its parent (which float cannot do), and all children can have an equal amount of available width/height regardless of how much is available (which `float` will stack on top of the content), and all columns in a multiple-column layout adot the same height even if they have different amount of content
- This topic can help me lay out websites that I would like to build much better especially when most images are different sizes
