## Application State with Redux

### Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials[^1]

- The first principle of Redux is regardless if the app is simple or complex, everything that changes in the application, including the data and UI is contained in a single object that's known as the state, or state tree.
- A *store* binds the three principles of Redux: holds current application state object, dispatch actions, and the specification of how the action is dispatched
- `getState()`: get the states of the current store
- `dispatch()`: dispatch action linked to the action
- `subsribve()`: render the content/state, so the UI can be updated

- `combineReducers()` is helpful because it allows the developer to define the state and action in a single function. It combines the state and the reducer in a single object. This allows the developer to combine all the reducers in a single statement so multiple reducers can be called using a single reducer
