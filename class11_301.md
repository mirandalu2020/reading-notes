### SQL vs NoSQL[^1]

- SQL	NoSQL

1. SQL is relationational, while noSQL is non-relational
2. SQL is table-based, while noSQL is document-based using key0value pairs, graph data-base or wide-column stores
3. SQL has pre-defined schema, and NoSQL is more dynamic
4. SQL is more standardized than noSQL, in the case of complex querying
5. SQL however, is not good for hierarchical data storage, noSQL is better for hierachical data style like JSON

- SQL is good for structured relational data, such as customer info for a store, and how the customer is related to orders and staffs and stores
- NoSQL is good for hiearchical data (non-relational), such as HTTP queries.
- SQL scales vertically (increased customer base or order), and NoSQL scales horizontally (increased field of queries)

### Video[^2]

- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- A relational database is structured in tables, which has stricter standards
- A schema is what defines what can go into the table (fields), items cannot have more fields than other items
- A NoSQL database is non-relational database, it works by implementing key-value pairs
- A MongoDB database is for NoSQL data-bases.
- MongoDB is more flexible, due to the lack of pre-defined strucuture and the data do not need to have the same fields (no schema)
- The disadvantage is the uncertainty of what key includes what value
