## Event Driven Applications

### Event Driven Programming[^1]

- `EventEmitter` is a native Node.js module that allows Event Driven Programming.
- One of the benefits of using OOP and Event-driven programming is that the object can be self-contained, which makes scaling an application easier. When used together, OOP and EDP can enhance the functionality and performance of software applications. OOP provides a way to model the entities in the system and encapsulate their behavior, while EDP provides a way to handle events and update the state of the system in response to those events[^2].
- Event driven programming is useful on the backend using Node.js because you wouldn't want to transmit info when it's needed to optimize performance, and how you can monitor the "when" is by a particular event. This can optimize data transmission, storage, and UX.
