### What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?[^1]

- RBAC restricts access based on a person's role within an organization, for example, an admin would have access to perform a full CRUD on a dabatabase but a generic user may only be able to read the data. 
- The benefits of RBAC is that it is efficient and repeatable. The access is tied to the role of a person rather than the person him/herself. So if the person leaves or is replaced, the replacement can just assume the role with no changes needed to be performed to the organization.
