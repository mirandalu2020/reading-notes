# Class Twelve Notes (201)

## Canvas, Chart.js

### JS Canvas[^1]

- `<canvas>` allows a developer to represent a 2D graphics using JS, with attributes of height and width
- The closing `</canvas>` tag shows the fallback content that will display only if the browser doesnâ€™t support the `<canvas>` element
- `getContext()` returns a rendered text object

### Chart Js[^2]

- Chart.js is a library that frequently used chart types, plugins, and customization options, one example of how it can be used in my project is to use it to render chart elements on a canvas. 
- Example of chart types that can be made include: box-plots, error bars, and financial charts (ex candle sticks).

### Animanted Charts[^3]

- Charts are easier to interpret and read than tables as they are more visual. It can communicate and analyze data more efficiently. 
- I can potentially use Chart.js to plot the table from the salmon-cookie project, so the sales of the day, by the hour, and by store can be more easily visualized.

## Things I want to know more about

- How to use chart with other data analytics methods such as regressions
