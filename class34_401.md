# Class Thirty-Four Notes (401)

## API Integration

### Review API Server Build

- A string parameter is identify a specific source, and query parameter is used to query a specific kind of data from the source
- For example, the URL below would become http://our-site.com/stuff/v3/things
Domain: http://our-site.com
v3
model name: stuff
id: things
- The interface is what the user sees and uses. It shows the user what they need and the user can follow the documentation to use the API for their specific needs

### Review Auth Server Build[^2]

- Middleware is written as its own module, and it will appear between the endpoint and the `(req, res) =>()`
- The handshake required to implement OAuth is when a client sends a POST request with request body which is sent in the HTTP request header, the decrypted username and password must match with what's stored in the database
- Role-based-access-control is sent with the request to be authorized, and the role determines how much rights the user have over the database
