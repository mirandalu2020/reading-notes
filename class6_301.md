- Node is a JS runtume means JS can be executed on the computers directly.
- NPM is the javascript package manager, which stands for node package manager.
- My current npm version is 9.2.0
- My current node version is 19.4.0
- To install jshint, type command `npm install -g jshint` (global)
- Node runs JavaScript on the server.
