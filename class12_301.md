# Class Twelve Notes

## REST

### HTTP Codes

100’s = informational, tells the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply
200’s = SUCCESS! Request accepted.

- 202: in the case of async request, it informs the client that the request met all validation requirements
- 204: no content, the code for updates that don't return data to the client

300’s = redirect, the request no longer available at the expected location

- 308 - permanent redirect

400’s = client error

- 403: forbidden: the client has no permission to access the resource
- 404: the resource used to exist but no longer does

500’s = Server error

### Build REST API[^2]

- Pulling our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env makes it easier to manage if the link changes from local to cloud environment
- Middleware is what connects modules together
- `app.use(express.json())` allows the server to accept JSON
- `/:id`: gives user access to whatever they put in after the id, it only allows a single router access
- The difference between `PUT` and `PATCH` is PATCH only passes whatever the user input is, while PUT will update all subsriber's info rather than just one
- To make a default value in a schema, by adding a `default` property to the model
- Status 200 means "everything ok", 201 is "created"
