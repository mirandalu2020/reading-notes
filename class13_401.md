# Class Thirteen Notes (401)

## Message Queues

### Socket.io Chat Example[^1]

- The code basically sends a message to the server when a connected user clickes the "submit button"
- On the backend, we can console log the connection and message being sent to the server by the user
- You can use "broadcasting" so the message will be sent to everyone except for the emitting socket;

### Rooms[^2]

- A room is where only connected users can broadcast and communicate to each other. You can join a room by using `socket.join(room-name)` and leave the room by using `socket.on('disconnecting', ()=>{ console.log(''eaving')})`

### Namespaces[^3]

- A namespace is a channel that allows the app to run over a single shared connection
- Each namespace can have its own event-handlers, rooms, and middlewares
- One example usecase of namespaces can be chat channels to different groups of people in an organization, so administrative employees' messages don't get passed on to gardeners.
