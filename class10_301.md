# Class Ten Notes (301)

## In Memory Storage


- A call is what the call stack is used for, a only one call can be executed at once
- 
- LIFO is Last In, First Out (LIFO), the last function gets put insde the stack is the first to be popped out when the function returns

> function firstFunction(){
>  console.log("Hello from firstFunction");
> } //returns and prints, then popped off the stack and move on to the secondFunction()

> function secondFunction(){ 
>   firstFunction();
>   console.log("The end from secondFunction");
> } //calls and pushes firstFunction() into the stack

> secondFunction(); //gets called first, create empty stack frame (entry point of the program)

- A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function calls itself) without an exist point, which will exceed the browser(hosting environment)'s maximum stack call

What is a ‘reference error’?
What is a ‘syntax error’?
What is a ‘range error’?
What is a ‘type error’?
