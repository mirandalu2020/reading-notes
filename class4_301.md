# Class Four Notes (301)

## React and Forms

### React - Forms[^1]

- Controlled Component: An input form element whose value is controlled by React
- The state is updated as soon as the user has an input, so the displayed value of state will be updated as the user types
- The user's input can be updated by tageting the input value

### The conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained[^2]

- A ternary operator shortens a conditional statement

>if(x===y){
>  console.log(true);
>} else {
>  console.log(false);
>}

- the above code can be re-written as: 
`x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)`
