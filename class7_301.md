# Class Seven Notes (301)

## REST

### Intro[^1]

- Roy Fielding helped writing HTTP, which is a protocal that's capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.
- The techniques used by later developers can get computers to talk to each other that didn't have the requirement to talk direclty to the rest of the world, they only need to be able to talk to a small number of machines.
- `GET`- machine get the data in machine-readable form
- `POST` - one system adds something to another system
- `PUT` - one system replaces something in another system
- `PATCH` - one system does a partial update in another system

### API Keys

- get API keys for geocoding, weather bit, Yelp, and the Movie DB (YES TO ALL!)
