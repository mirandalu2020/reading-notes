## Using the terminam

### **Day two exasperation**

The terminal follows a pretty stricit order when running, something forgetting a step can be a nightmare, but at least it gives some sort of hint and surprisingly they are quite helpful (at least more so than Excel).

Lesson of the day: get to the directory --> clone --> check status (and then ACP)
