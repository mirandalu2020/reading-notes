# Class Notes

## Title

### getting started with react native[^1]

- Core components of React Native include `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<Image>`, `<ScrollView>`, and `<TextInput>`. 

- `<View>` is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, touch handling, and accessibility controls, similarly to a `div`
- `<TextInput>` allows user to enter texts
- `<Image>` display types of images

- *React Native* solves the problem of building apps on different platforms like iOS, Android, and web app using the same code base. It's called native because it uses the materials provided by the native platforms rather than webviews[^2]

- The building blocks of a React Native app include Text and View. React is faster in displaying dynamic content as it uses a virtual DOM, however React Native uses a real DOM provided by the material of the native platform[^3]

### expo[^3]

- Expo is a set of tools built on top of React Native. These tools depend on one key belief held at Expo: it's possible to build most apps without ever needing to write native code, provided that you have a comprehensive set of APIs exposed to JavaScript[^4]
- Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the developer-friendly workflow.
- On the other hand, Expo is a set of tools, libraries, and services built around React Native. Expo provides additional capabilities and simplifies the development process for React Native applications.Which simplies dev workflow, and no native code is required.

### expo snack[^5]

- Expo snack is a web-based development environment provided by Expo. It allows the developer to write React Native code, preview app in real time, and access expo API's and components. 

### ejecting[^6]

- Eject means leaving the development environment in Expo, where the developer can jump to native Android and iOS projects, or to use ExpoKit.
- Ejecting is not recommended if the project is small or it's a prototyping project, or when the functionality is limited in the app.
- You should eject from expo is when the developer is creating a new Native functionality, developing a platform-specific code, or trying to optimize performance
