# Class Four Notes

## Intro to HTML

### **Vocab**

1. HTML - hypertext markup language
2. Semantic - name plainly describe its meaning/purpose
3. tags - block name enclosed in <>
4. elements: used to enclose different parts of the content for final product appearance
5. Attribute - extra information of the element
6. void elements - elements without content

### **Things to note (HTML basics)**[^1]

- HTML is there to structure the webpage
- opening element (opening tag + content+ closing tag): `<h1>contents goes here</h1>`
- another example: `<a href="url goes here">Content</a>`

- to insert an image element use `<img/>`

- an attribute is 1 space between the element name or previous attribute, it has an equal sign, and the value is presented as "*insert value*".
- Marking up text includes using `headings <h1>,<h2>.. etc; paragraphs <p>; lists <ul>=unordered, <ol>=ordered;  links <a> or <a href="url">`

### **Wireframe and Design**[^2]

Wireframing is used by UX designers to plan ahead for a project with using color or text type, based on what a client desires to be presented on their site. The implementation of wireframing vary, but basically they all involve sketching first, and then turn the sketch into code. It's worth noting that wireframing does not have to be done in code,it can be done using pen and pencils.

The process of wireframing are as follows: research --> prepare research for reference --> mapping user flow (information architecture) --> draft and sketch --> brief details+testing --> turn into prototypes. The goal of wireframing is to present a simple and clear product that shows confidence.

### Semantics in HTML

Semantics in HTML gives meaning to the content it wraps, for instance: `<h1>top level heading</h1>` contains the semantic element `<h1>`. Although some elements can make the contents have the same appearance, it is not a semantic element (ex. `<span style ="font-size": xx;margin: xx>Content</span>`). See a list of semantic elements [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics).

Note that HTML should be responsible for content only, styling is covered by CSS.
