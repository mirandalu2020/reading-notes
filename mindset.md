# Mindset Notes

## Mindset for the class

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I can bring in positivity and new perspective to the career. I always enjoy problem solving in innovative ways and and I enjoy challenges.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- The first thing I need to do is to walk away. There has been way too many instances of me trying to figure out a single bug for hours, but as soon as I go home, have dinner, and look at the same piece of code again, I could almost always debug within 30 minutes.
- The second thing I need to do is talking to someone that I believe could solve my problems. I also have way too many instances that I just go to the TA and explained my problem, and I saw where the problem was. When I did the same thing with myself or someone I just tried to speak to, I barely went anywhere.
- The third thing I need to do should be trying to is to make the project fun. When the project intrinctly interest me, I always try my best. So if I look at something with a new perspective, I feel more motivated.
