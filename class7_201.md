# Class Seven Notes (201)

## More on Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

### Domain Modeling[^1]

- Domain modeling models a problem, such that there's a direction to find the solutions

### HTML Table Basics[^2]

- Tables should be used as they are very readable, and they are accessible to screen reader clients, so it's helpful for visually impaired users
- Examples of `<table>` semantic tags include: `<th>` (table headers), `<td>` (table data), `<colspan>`, `<rowspam>`

### Intro to Constructors[^3] [^4]

- A *Constructor* is a function called using the `new` key word, such that a new object will be creaetd
- `this` can be used to bind to the constructor code and refer to itself
- examples of a prototype: I used to have to make chemical models before running the experiment. More basic scientific experiment required me do prototype the reaction on paper, more advanced ones requires programming

## Things I want to know more about

- how to make my code from lab6 more clean?
