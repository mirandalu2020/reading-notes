## CSS Transforms and Animations

### CSS Transforms[^1]

- The CSS transform allows an developer to alter the appearance of a figure on the webpage, by altering the size, position, and elements
- This technique can be used to make pseudo-animation effect by changing the position of an element upon an event takes place. For instance, in a game of catching stars, the user can click on a star and the `translate` property can be used to move the star to the bucket in the lower-right corner.

### CSS Transitions and Animations[^2]

- Transition allows a developer to alter the state of an element
- One transition only allows one state to be changed, while animation can have multiple states to be changed

**Other Notes**[^3]

- CSS can benefit for websites as they can make website changes to look more visually appealing, and can better communicate with visual users for what they are clicking on or hovering over
- This can be useful as I always wanted to make a personal recipe book, and having the transitions will allow me to make my website to look smoother
