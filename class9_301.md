# Class Nine Notes (301)

## Functional Programming[^1]

- Functional programming is a style of building the structure and element of computer pgrograms that treats computation as the evaluation of matth functions
- A pure function returns the same result if it's givent the same arguments (deterministric), and does not cause any observable side effects
- The benefits of a pure function it's easier for code-testing
- Immutability is something stays unchanged over time or unable to be changed
- Referential transparency consistently yields the same result for the same input

## Node: Mdules and require()[^2]

- Module is another JS file
- `Require` brings in another JS file to the current file
- A different module can be brought in to the file we are working in by `require`, and specify what part of the module to be made available, by using `module.exports = <var contains the function>`
- To make a module available
