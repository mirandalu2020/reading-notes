## AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

### AWS API Gateway Overview[^1]

- Amazon API gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or WebSocket API
- It's is important to a serverless ecosystem because it replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution
- API Gateway integrates with other AWS services by invoking AWS Lambda function, invoking another HTTP endpoint, making HTTP call against the API of any AWS service that provides an HTTP API, then it returns a mock response generated within API Gateway wihtout calling out to other services


### AWS API Gateway[^2]

- Benefits of using Amazon API Gateway include being able to have services at small or larger scale, easy monitoring, efficient API development. 
- The API types availabe include RESTful APIs and Websocket APIs.
