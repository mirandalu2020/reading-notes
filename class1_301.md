## Intro to React and Components

### React - Component-Based Architecture[^1]

- A Component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that can better implement the higher-level interfaces
- A component is reusable, replacable, not context-specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent.
- The advantages of using a component in web-dev is it makes feature deployment and development easier, lowers cost, reusable, modifies the technical complexity, reliable, lower system maintenance and evolution, and indepent.

### React - Props and How to Use Them in React[^2]

- "Props" is short for "properties", it passes data from one component to another, in a uni-direction way (only from parent to child).
- Props is used in the following steps: defining an attribute and its value, then pass to the child components, and finally the props data is being rendered.
- The flow of props is unidirectional, from parent to child.

## Things I want to know more about

How is React actually implemented with all the features we are trying to develop for a website/app?
