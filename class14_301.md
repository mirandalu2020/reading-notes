# Class Fourteen Notes (301)

## Diversity and Inclusion

### Section 1[^1]

- As home PC became more popular, the population of women in tech declined.
- Playing computer games exposed the person to the concept earlier than others, so in an introductory class when the professor assumed the students know the basics of computers, many girls were falling behind.

### Section 2[^2]

- Diversity efforts are most successful when driven by the leaders. A diverse company perform better because diversity can bring in more innovative ideas
- A diverse company can serve a diverse user base because the company can potentially understand its users more comprehensively.
