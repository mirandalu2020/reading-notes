## AWS: Events

### AWS SQS and SNS[^1]

- SNS is the Simple Notification Service and SQS is the Simple Queue Service.
- The difference between them is that SNS is a publisher/subsriber system, which a topic can deliver to many subscribers; while SQS is a queueing service for message processing, and an event is required to deliver the message
- Use case of SNS: once a costumer is authenticated, a SNS is broadcasted to multiple services to allow the customer to make purchases
- Use case of SQS: the authentication message will be specific to each service (ex. authenticated customer have access to serviceA, serviceB, and serviceC), when the customer sends a request to serviceA, serviceA would have a different response than serviceB, so a response sent out to the customer would be an SQS case.
- A "fanout" system is a message being delivered to a wide range of receivers
- "Push notification" with SNS is the delivery of a message when a particular event occurs
