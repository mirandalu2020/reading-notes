## Redux - Additional Topics

### Redux Toolkit (RTK)[^1]

- Redux toolkit should address common concerns including complications of configuring a redux store, installing too many packages, and excess of boilerplate code.
- `confiureStore()` wraps `createStore` which comes with many defaults. This funcition automatically combines slice reducers, adds Redux middleware (including redux-thunk by default), and additional tols can be added using Redux DevTools Extension
- `createSlice()` takes in a name and an initial state value, it generates a slice reducer with corresonding action creators and action types.

### MobX[^2]

- Mobx is a state management tool that's designed to be scalable. It's makes it "impossible" to produce an inconsistent state by deriving states automatically.
